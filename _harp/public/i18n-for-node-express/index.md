In this post i'm going to demonstrate a simple way to add multi language support to a node + express project.

### Simple server
Lets start with a simple server:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mderazon/7229439.js"></script>

We first require `express`, then we tell express where to look for our templates files. In this case I used `ejs` as the template engine. I like it because it's syntax is basically html with special `<% ... %>` syntax for embedding code from the server. There are other (and more popular) template engines you can chose from.

In line 7 we add a route for `/` and tell it to render `index.ejs`. 

Lets create our `index.ejs` file under `/views` dir.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mderazon/7229648.js"></script>

Nothing special here, just plain html page. Express guesses what type of template to render by the extension. So when it sees `index.ejs` it knows it should first pass it through the `ejs` module to render.

### Adding translation module

Now lets add the i18n functionality. I use [i18n-node](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) module. Create another file `i18n.js` :

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mderazon/7229824.js"></script>

First we set up some configurations. By default, i18n module uses `accept-language` request header to guess language settings. You can tell it to look for a cookie that contains the language if you want. In this case I used a cookie named `lang`.

Now lets import our newly created module in our server file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mderazon/7230558.js"></script>

In line 7 we add the i18n module as middleware. Make sure you put it before any route is defined. What i18n module does is add a special function called `__()` to the response object. This function takes care of the translation. 

We need to add the translation `__()` method to the view file as well :
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mderazon/7230774.js"></script>



### Translation files
Now when you run the app, notice that i18n creates a folder in a location we previously defined in `i18n.js`. This folder will contain the translation files. In my case, I have two locales : `en` and `iw` so i18n will create two files :

- `locales/en.json`
- `locales/iw.json`

The format is very simple. A valid JSON file that contains `"sentence" : "translation"` pairs. The first time we try to GET `/` i18n will automatically populate the files. Since I am using English in my code, i18n will populate `en.json` with:

```
{
	"Hello i18n": "Hello i18n"
}
```

I will have to edit `iw.json` with the translation :

```
{
	"Hello i18n": "שלום i18n"
}
```

### Results
Lets test that everything is working okay. I am using [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm/details?hl=en) (which kicks ass) to call the server. First lets make a call with `Accept-Language=en` header to see the english version :

Now lets change the header for `Accept-Language=iw` (iw = Hebrew in case you wondered) :

###Some notes

- Use escape `\` character if you want insert problematic characters : `__("can\'t do that")`. Otherwise nasty things will happen.
- In express `2.x` you need to specifically add `__()` function to the locals object. Do it by adding the following line just after `i18n.init()` in the i18n module :

```
res.local('__', res.__);
```
